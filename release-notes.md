## Changelog

* Core:
    * If running from source, automatic updates will not be checked as this works only for distribution. ([#540](https://github.com/MCV-Software/TWBlue/pull/540))
    * Fixed the 'report an error' item in the help menu. Now this item redirects to our gitHub issue tracker. ([#524](https://github.com/MCV-Software/TWBlue/pull/524))
* Mastodon:
    * Implemented update profile dialog. ([#547](https://github.com/MCV-Software/TWBlue/pull/547))
    * It is possible to display an user profile from the user menu within the menu bar, or by using the invisible keystroke for user details. ([#555](https://github.com/MCV-Software/TWBlue/pull/555))
    * Added possibility to vote in polls.
    * Added posts search. Take into account that Mastodon instances should be configured with full text search enabled. Search for posts only include posts the logged-in user has interacted with. ([#541](https://github.com/MCV-Software/TWBlue/pull/541))
